Looking at your architecture, you're currently using CoinGecko's free API which is solid for crypto price data, historical charts, and market info. However, depending on what you want to build, you might want to consider:
API Strategy
For Crypto:

CoinGecko (what you have) - Good for basic price data, market caps, historical data
CoinGecko Pro - If you need higher rate limits (50 calls/min vs 10-30 on free)
Alternative: CryptoCompare - Free tier is generous, good for real-time data
For on-chain data: You'd need something like Etherscan API, Blockchain.com API, or Moralis

You're fine with just CoinGecko for now unless you hit rate limits or need real-time WebSocket feeds.
Expanding to Stock Market
Yes, absolutely doable. Here's the landscape:
Free/Freemium APIs:

Alpha Vantage - 25 calls/day free, stocks, forex, crypto
Finnhub - 60 calls/min free, great for stocks, news, financial data
Yahoo Finance (unofficial) - Through yfinance Python library, no key needed but rate-limited
Polygon.io - Free tier: 5 calls/min, delayed data

Architecture additions you'd need:
python# Add to your FastAPI backend
class AssetType(Enum):
    CRYPTO = "crypto"
    STOCK = "stock"

class MarketDataService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.coingecko = CoinGeckoAPI()
        self.alpha_vantage_key = os.getenv('ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY')
        self.finnhub_key = os.getenv('FINNHUB_KEY')
    
    def get_price(self, symbol: str, asset_type: AssetType):
        if asset_type == AssetType.CRYPTO:
            return self._get_crypto_price(symbol)
        else:
            return self._get_stock_price(symbol)
TradingView + Arkham Intelligence Features
TradingView-like features:

Advanced charting (use Chart.js or Lightweight Charts library on frontend)
Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Moving Averages) - calculate server-side
Multiple timeframes (1m, 5m, 1h, 1d, etc.)
Drawing tools for technical analysis
Alerts and price notifications (you already have Telegram bot!)

Arkham Intelligence-like features (this is the interesting part):

Wallet tracking and labeling
Transaction flow visualization
On-chain metrics (would need Etherscan/Moralis)
Portfolio tracking across addresses
Entity clustering (who owns what)

Realistic Scope
For a portfolio project that impresses Israeli tech companies:
Phase 1 (what you have + minimal additions):

Keep CoinGecko for crypto
Add Alpha Vantage or Finnhub for stocks
Unified search: "BTC" vs "AAPL" auto-detects asset type
Basic charts for both

Phase 2 (TradingView lite):

Interactive charting with Lightweight Charts
Technical indicators (calculate server-side, cache results)
Custom watchlists stored in SQLite
Price alerts via Telegram

Phase 3 (Arkham lite - if you want to go hard):

Wallet address tracking (Etherscan API)
Portfolio aggregation across addresses
Basic transaction history and labeling

My Recommendation
Start with Phase 1: Add stock market support using Finnhub (better free tier than Alpha Vantage). The unified crypto + stock tracker with your existing Telegram bot integration is already a strong portfolio piece.
The architecture you have is solid - SQLite for storing watchlists/alerts, FastAPI for backend, Gemini for natural language queries. Adding stocks is mostly about:

Adding another API client class
Updating your data models to handle both asset types
Frontend tweaks to show stock-specific data (P/E ratio, market cap, etc.)

-----------------------


I've laid out the full architecture for expanding your crypto app to include stock market data. Key points:
Quick answers to your questions:

CoinGecko API - Stick with it for crypto, no other crypto API needed unless you hit rate limits
Stock expansion - Absolutely doable, use Finnhub (60 calls/min free vs Alpha Vantage's 25 calls/day)

What I included:

Complete database schema updates for mixed asset types
Service layer architecture with factory pattern for clean API switching
Phase-by-phase implementation (Phase 1 is ~1-2 days, gets you stocks working)
Technical indicators code for TradingView-like features
Optional Arkham Intelligence wallet tracking approach
Caching strategy to avoid burning through API limits

The unified search that auto-detects "BTC" vs "AAPL" is the killer feature here - makes it feel professional. Combined with your existing Telegram bot, this becomes a genuinely useful tool.
For Israeli tech interviews, this project hits multiple sweet spots: API integration, financial domain knowledge, clean architecture patterns, and real-world caching/rate-limiting considerations.
